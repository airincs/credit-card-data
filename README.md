- Microsoft SQL Server was used initially to gather some insights into the data. After SQL, Python was used to analyze the data and to create several models.

## Purpose? Why?
This goal of this analysis was to see what variables most impact someone's chances at getting approved for a credit card. After some feature exploring, deciding on a most effective predictive model was the next step.

## Results

We can conclude that a Logistic Regression model would be the most fitting.

Some interesting variables:

From the Correlation Matrix:
Looking at the Approval column, we can see what variables have the most influence on getting approved or not.
- Variables that positively influence approval chances: PriorDefault, Employment, CreditScore, and YearsEmployed
- Variables that negatively influence approval chances: Industry and Ethnicity
